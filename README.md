# DASHBOARD-DEVELOPMENT

COMPANY:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME:JINKA DEEKSHITHA

INTERN ID:CTO4DF390

DOMAIN:DATA ANALYTICS

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

 OBJECTIVE:I was required to develop an interactive dashboard using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Dash. I chose Power BI for this project due to its user-friendly interface and strong data visualization capabilities. The purpose of this task was to analyze a dataset related to student depression and mental health and present the findings in a visually meaningful and interactive way.The dataset I selected was based on a Student Depression Test, which consisted of survey responses from students about their academic life, mental health, sleep patterns, social habits, and awareness of counseling. The objective was to analyze this data and build a dashboard that helps identify students at risk of depression and provide actionable insights for schools or mental health professionals.Before building the dashboard, I cleaned and prepared the data using Power BI’s Power Query Editor. This step is very important because raw data is often messy. In this case, I removed duplicate records, corrected spelling mistakes (e.g., "5-2 hours" changed to 5-2 hours)
 
 FINAL THOUGHTS:This internship task was an excellent opportunity for me to apply my data analysis and Power BI skills to a real-life problem. It gave me a clear understanding of the steps involved in dashboard development—from data collection and cleaning to visual storytelling and delivering actionable insights. I also learned how powerful tools like Power BI can be in turning boring spreadsheets into dynamic dashboards that actually help people make better decisionThis project can be extended further in the future. For example, I could integrate data from different colleges, add geographic or time-based analysis, or even create an automated alert system for high-risk students. But as a starting point, this dashboard provides a solid foundation for identifying depression trends among students and promoting mental health awareness in education systems.
